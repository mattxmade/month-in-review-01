      <p>This month saw me start my journey learning full stack developement through The Odin Project. 
        So far I have learnt how to write HTML CSS and some JavaScript. In taking up this curriculum I also decided to commit
        to the #100DaysOfCode challenge. This has entailed
        me tweeting daily about my progress. The idea is that
        by committing to the challenge, you hold yourself
        to coding for at least two hours a day.</p>

        <br>
        
        <p>So far, so good and as of this writing, I am now on
        day 32; having started on 1st January 2022.
        I felt it was nessecary to undertake this challenge 
        as I am not really one for publishing my work (or social media for that matter) so I thought it best
        to work on this painpoint as building on the web means being present on it.</p>

      <br>

      <p>My progress with The Odin Project curriculum has been
        good. I dabbled with HTML and CSS some years ago through
        Codecademy so I was somewhat familiar with the concepts.
        This was in 2015 and frameworks like bootstrap were
        very popular as they made laying out a page easier.
        I also recall using the CSS float property quite alot.
        Bringing things up-to-date, the Flexbox module has been
        a real standout.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Through watching YouTube videos and scrolling Twiiter,
        I've also blown away by what others are designing
        purely with CSS. From 3D elements to complex
        recreations of handheld game consoles; some seriously
        brilliant stuff!</p>

      <br>

      <p>Around ten days into January I completed The Odin Project 'Recipes' page 
        project. In doing so I learned about GitHub, the
        command line, gitBash and whole myriad of other
        small things. Although the commands were somewhat
        cumbersome for me at the start, they have now become
        reflex.</p>

        <br>

      <p>I also completed the 'Landing Page' project which
        saw me utilising the Flexbox module to layout a webpage
        following instructuins from a brief. This was a super enjoyable
        project and I found the challenge of getting things to look as close
        as possible to the reference compelling.</p>

      <p>The final big Odin related project for this month was using what I had 
        learned through the JavaScript fundamentals Odin Lessons
        to build a Rock Paper Scissors game. This saw me creating
        functions, using let and const variables, returns,
        conditionals, switch statements and operators (comparative and logical)
        to build out the logic and flow of the game.
      </p>

      <p>After planning things out and writing some psuedo code, I 
        set about building everything up one function at a time,
        making sure everything worked as I expected. I finshied the project
        on 30th January 2022 and I'm happy with it. I still need to iron
        some bugs but as my first full JavaScript program I am encouraged by the
        outcome and feel more confident with the JavaScript language. I am
        looking forward to returning to this to add a GUI using HTML + CSS. 
      </p>

      <p>Lastly as a method to reflect on my learning each month, I have started this blog.
        My plan is to style each month's blog after notable websites. This month is
        in the style of a medium article. This took a day or so to build out and my goal
        with the blog series is to better my skills in HTML and CSS, picking up new skills as
        I go.
      </p>

      <p>Thanks for checking this out, Matty.</p>
