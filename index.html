      <p>This month saw me start my journey learning full stack developement through The Odin Project. 
        So far I have learnt how to write HTML CSS and some JavaScript. In taking up this curriculum, I also decided to commit
        to the #100DaysOfCode challenge. This has entailed
        me tweeting daily about my progress. The idea is that
        by committing to the challenge, you hold yourself
        to coding for at least two hours a day.</p>

        <br>
        
        <p>So far, so good and as of this writing, I am now on
        day 31; having started on 1st January 2022.
        I felt this was nessecary to undertake this challenge 
        as I am not really one for publishing my work (or social media for that matter) so I thought it best
        to work on this painpoint as building on the web means being present on it.</p>

      <br>

      <p>My progress with The Odin Project curriculum has been
        good. I dabbled with HTML and CSS some years ago through
        Codecademy so I was somewhat familiar with the concepts.
        This was in 2015 and frameworks like bootstrap were
        very popular (still is) as they made laying out a page easier.
        I also recall using the CSS float property quite alot.
        Bringing things uptodate, the Flexbox module has been
        a real standout so far and shows how much progress
        been made since my learnings in 2015.</p>

      <br>

      <p>On being on Twitter and watching YouTube videos,
        I'm also blown away by what others are designing
        purely with CSS. From 3D elements to complex
        recreations of handheld game consoles; some seriously
        brilliant stuff!</p>

      <br>

      <p>Around ten days in I completed The Odin Project recipe page 
        project. In doing so I learned about GitHub, the
        command line, gitBash and whole myriad of other
        small things. Although the commands were somewhat
        cumbersome for me at the start, they soon became
        reflex.</p>
